🏎️ Carmetic Detailing | Luxury Automotive Care
- A premium digital experience for a high-end automotive detailing brand.

📌 Project Overview
- Carmetic Detailing is a high-performance web application designed to bridge the gap between luxury automotive artistry and digital convenience. The goal was to create a visual-first platform that reflects the precision of the detailing craft while providing a seamless UX for high-ticket service discovery and booking.

🛠️ Tech Stack
- Frontend: React / Next.js (Speed & SEO optimization)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (Custom utility-first design system)
- Animations: Framer Motion (Smooth, "luxury-feel" transitions)
- Infrastructure: AWS (Cloud hosting and scalability)
- Payments: Stripe (Secure checkout for service deposits)

✨ Key Features & UX Architecture
1. Modern "Bento" UI Architecture
- The project utilizes a modular "Bento" grid for project showcases and service tiers. This ensures a clean, organized layout that remains fully responsive across all devices.
- Custom Hover Logic: Sophisticated CSS interactions that provide visual feedback without cluttering the aesthetic.

2. Secure Payment Integration
- Implemented Stripe to handle secure bookings and deposits. This includes:
- Dynamic pricing based on vehicle size/service tier.
- Success/Cancel redirection flows for a frictionless user journey.

3. AWS Cloud Integration
- Deployed using AWS to ensure high availability and fast content delivery (CDN), crucial for a site heavy on high-resolution vehicle imagery.

🎨 Design Philosophy: "Digital Precision"
- To match the brand's identity, the UI follows a Minimalist Dark Theme using:
1. High-Contrast Typography: Clear hierarchy to guide the user toward the "Book Now" call-to-action.
2. Motion Design: Subltle scroll-triggered animations that mimic the smoothness of a ceramic-coated finish.
3. Visual Trust: Dedicated sections for "AWS + Stripe" integrations to signal technical reliability and payment security to the customer.
